# Bullet Journal

It's a methodology to keep track of your stuff like tasks, events, notes by creating the bullets. I found that I love this method and easily adapt to it than other tools that I've tried like Trello, note-taking apps, to-do apps.

## Usage

```
o this is a new task.
x completed task.

Let's create a @tag

Prioritize your task using !low !medium !high

# You can use common markdown's syntax like:

**bold**
_italic_
~~strike through~~

# Some ordered list

1. First
2. Second
3. And the final
```
