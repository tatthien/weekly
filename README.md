# Weekly

It's a methodology to keep track of your stuff like tasks, events, notes by creating the bullets. I found that I love
this method and easily adapt to it than other tools that I've tried like Trello, note-taking apps, to-do apps.

## Usage

```
[ ] Open
[@] Ongoing
[x] Completed
[~] Obsolete

^ an event.

## A bullet list

- Item 1
- Item 2

## An ordered list

1. First
2. Second
3. And the final

Let's create a @tag

Prioritize your task using !low !medium !high

## You can use common markdown's syntax like:

**bold**
_italic_
~~strike through~~
`code`
```
